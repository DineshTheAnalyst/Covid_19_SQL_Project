# Covid 19 SQL Project

This is my portfolio project where I formatted, cleaned, and Analysed the Covid-19 data
from Our world In Data(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) using SQL queries to 
look for trends and patterns which can help us make sense of the data and guide our decision-making in the future.

The attached SQL file contains all the code that was used in the process; comments have been added to make the code easier to read.
